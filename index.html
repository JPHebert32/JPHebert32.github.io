  <p>I am a professional with 10+ years' experience at a proprietary trading firm, ultimately with a position as a trade-floor operator in a supervisory role. In this position, I worked closely with talented data scientists and became familiar with technologies such as Python, which our team used to execute and optimize our trading strategies. I also became an expert in Excel and working within large datasets. I am now pursuing advanced education that builds on my existing experience with data technologies and opens the door to a challenging new career in data science.

  <p>I love MLB and like to imitate the big boys by playing softball with my longtime team. On weekends, you'll find me out fishing, modding my Jeep Wrangler or daydreaming about modding my Jeep Wrangler. I'm a dad of two kids. My son (age 6) has a prosthetic leg featuring a Megalodon shark. My daughter (age 2) loves swords and floor snacks. Being their dad is my favorite job.
